The setPriority() method of thread class is used to change the thread's priority. Every thread has a priority 
which is represented by the integer number between 1 to 10.

Thread class provides 3 constant properties:

public static int MIN_PRIORITY: It is the maximum priority of a thread. The value of it is 1.

public static int NORM_PRIORITY: It is the normal priority of a thread. The value of it is 5.

public static int MAX_PRIORITY: It is the minimum priority of a thread. The value of it is 10.

Syntax:-

public final void setPriority(int a)
