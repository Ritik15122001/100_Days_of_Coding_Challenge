In Java, a LinkedList is a data structure that stores elements in a non-contiguous location. It is a linear data structure.

How to insert a node at a particular location of a Linked List? To insert a node at a particular location, we have to redirect the next
pointer of the previous node to point to the new node instead of the current one and the next pointer of the new node must point to the original next node.

Algorithm:-
STEP 1: IF PTR = NULL
WRITE OVERFLOW
    GOTO STEP 12
   END OF IF

STEP 2: SET NEW_NODE = PTR
STEP 3: NEW_NODE → DATA = VAL
STEP 4: SET TEMP = HEAD
STEP 5: SET I = 0
STEP 6: REPEAT STEP 5 AND 6 UNTIL I
STEP 7: TEMP = TEMP → NEXT
STEP 8: IF TEMP = NULL
WRITE "DESIRED NODE NOT PRESENT"
     GOTO STEP 12
    END OF IF
 END OF LOOP

STEP 9: PTR → NEXT = TEMP → NEXT
STEP 10: TEMP → NEXT = PTR
STEP 11: SET PTR = NEW_NODE
STEP 12: EXIT
