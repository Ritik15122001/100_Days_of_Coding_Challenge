SUPER KEYWORD:- The super keyword in Java refers to the immediate parent class reference.
The super keyword is used to access the data members, methods as well as the constructor of the parent class


It is used to refer to an instance variable of the immediate parent class.


It is used to invoke a method of the immediate parent class.


It is used to invoke a constructor of immediate parent class


Explanation:-  the Child class extends the Parent class. Both have two instance variables
In the Child class the print method calls the instance variables of the parent class using the super keyword.
In comparison, the instance variables of child class don't need one. It doesn't matter whether the instance variable of 
parent class and child class share the same name; they can hold different values and are not overridden
the child class extends parent class. While creating an object of the child class, the constructor of the child class is called, 
where the parent class constructor is invoked using the “super” keyword.


Sample Input:- 14 , 3

Sample Output:- i am the base over loadded constructor14
                I am the derived  with 14 with 3
                
Sample Input:- 10 , 12 

Sample Output:- i am the base over loadded constructor10
                I am the derived  with 10 with 12
