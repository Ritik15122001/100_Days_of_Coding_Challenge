Linked List :- Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.

A node contains two fields i.e. data stored at that particular address and the pointer which contains the address of the next node in the memory.

The last node of the list contains pointer to the null.

Uses of Linked List

The list is not required to be contiguously present in the memory. The node can reside any where in the memory and linked together to make a
list. This achieves optimized utilization of space.

list size is limited to the memory size and doesn't need to be declared in advance.

Empty node can not be present in the linked list.

We can store values of primitive types or objects in the singly linked list.

types of Linked List

Following are the various types of linked list.

Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.
