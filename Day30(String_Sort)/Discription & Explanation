String:- String is the Set of Characters .string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. An array of characters works same as Java string

char[] ch={'r','i','t','i','k'};  

String s=new String(ch);  

String s="ritik";  



Explanation:-First We have to take input of 5 String by Using For Loop and then we use nested of for loop after that we have to compare previous character of element
then and sort the strings and after that we print all the strings 



Java String class provides a lot of methods to perform operations on strings such as compare(), concat(), equals(), split(), length(), replace(), 
compareTo(), intern(), substring() etc.
