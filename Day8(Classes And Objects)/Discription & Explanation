By this Problem we know how to find area of rectangle by Using the Concept of class and Object 

Explanation:- First We input the Value Of length and breadth and then make the Object of that Particular Class. through Object of class we can access the 
Member of that Particular Class. we call the Method area that method for Calculating the Area of rectangle and then we simply Print that output on screen 

Example 1:-
Input Test case:- 
Smaple Input:- Length=10
               Breadth=12
Sample Output:- The Area of Rectangle is  = 120 

Example 2:-
Input Test case:- 
Smaple Input:- Length=20
               Breadth=60
Sample Output:- The Area of Rectangle is  = 1200

Example 3:-
Input Test case:- 
Sample Input:- Length=1.2 
               Breadth=2.01
Sample output:- Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException
