For Each Loop:- A for-each loop is a loop that can only be used on a collection of items. It will loop through the collection and each time 
through the loop it will use the next item from the collection. It starts with the first item in the array (the one at index 0)
and continues through in order to the last item in the array.


Synatax:- 
for (initialization; boolean-condition; step) {
    statement;
}

For each iteration  the for-each loop takes each element of the collection and stores it in a loop variable. 
Thus it executes the code written in the body of the loop for each element of the array or collection.

Sample Input:- "Ritik","sachin","vivek","ayush"

Sample Output:- Ritik	sachin	vivek	 ayush
