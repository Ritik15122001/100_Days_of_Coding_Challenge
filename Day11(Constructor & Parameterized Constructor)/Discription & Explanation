Discription:- A Constructor is a Special Member Function the constructor is invoked when ever an object of its an object of
its class is created the used of constructor is to initialized the objects of its class a constructor that accepts no parameters is called the default constructor 
the constructor function have same special characteristristics 

Parameterized Constructor (Overloaded Constructor):- Parameterized constructor accepts parameters and 
is used to assign these parameters to the data members of the class. There may be many
definitions of the parameterized constructor depending upon the type and number of parameters passed
to the constructor and so it is also called overloaded constructor.

Default Constructor (No argument constructor):- A default constructor accepts no parameters. When no constructor is defined in the class, 
compiler provides the default constructor.

explanation:-first we make the class and and the  make a constructor & another constructor overloaded and then we craete a object of that particular class then 
when we make the constructor the object is initilize at the time of creating of object then we initlize with parameter and then output is printed 

Syntax:- 
class ClassName {

   ClassName() {
   }
   
}

Parameterized Constructor Synatx :- 
class ClassName {

   ClassName() {
   }
   
   ClassName(Int a){
   
   }
   
}
