Multilevel Inheritence:- When a class already inherited by other class and then any other class is inherited by that class then we can say it is the concept 
of multiple inheritence 

Here we can see this concept by this diagram 


                                    
                                    Class A (Grand Parent Class)
                                      ^
                                      |
                                    Class B  (Parent Class )
                                      ^
                                      |
                                    Class C  (Child Class)
                                    
    Syntax:-
    
    class A { 
... .. ... 
};
class B extends  A {
... .. ...
};
class extends  B {
... ... ...
};
