Deleting a node from the beginning of the list is the simplest operation of all. It just need a few adjustments in the node pointers. 
Since the first node of the list is to be deleted, therefore, we just need to make the head, point to the next of the head.

How do you delete an element from a linked list?

Delete from a Linked List
Delete from beginning. Point head to the second node head = head->next;

Delete from end. Traverse to second last element. Change its next pointer to null struct node* temp = head;
while(temp->next->next!=NULL){ temp = temp->next; } temp->next = NULL;


Delete from middle.


PseudoCode:-Node currentNode = head;

    If head==null  then,

        System.out.println("List is Empty");

    Else 

        head=currentNode.next;
