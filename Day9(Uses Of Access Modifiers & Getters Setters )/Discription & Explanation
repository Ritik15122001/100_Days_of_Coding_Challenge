Problem:- Finding The Area Of Cylinder By using Private and Public Variables and Using Getter and Setters.

Input Test Case:- Input Must Be Integer 

Sample Input:- radius=5, hieght=7;
Sample Output:- 769.3

Sample Input:- radius=10, hieght=14;
Sample Output:- 6154.4


Discription:- There are four  types of access modifiers in java 
              1.Private 
              2.Public
              3.Protected
              4.Default 
Private:- it can access only within class no other class can access outside that particular class .
Public :- It can Be access from outside the class 
Protected:- It is Just Like a Private access modifier can`t be access from outside the class but it can be access the derived class of any class 
Default:- it can be access within the that particular package 


Explanation:- First we make another class called Cylinder and in this class there are a public variable and a Private variable and some getters & Setters 
through which we can access the private variable from outside the class and then we make objects of cylinder class through getradius and gethieght we initiate the 
private variable radius and hieght . there are one more method called surfacearea here we calculate the area of cylinder and get Output.
